# Mini Projects with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of mini web development projects built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These projects are part of a hands-on, project-based course designed to strengthen your understanding of the **DOM (Document Object Model)** and core web development concepts.

## 🎯 About the Projects

Each project focuses on different aspects of frontend development, including:

- DOM manipulation and events  
- CSS animations and transitions  
- Responsive design using Flexbox and Media Queries  
- JavaScript fundamentals like arrays, functions, and HTTP requests  

## 🧩 Planned Projects

  
- Scroll Animation  
- Dad Jokes Generator  
- Todo List  
...and more to be added over time!
