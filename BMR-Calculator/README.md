# BMR Calculator Tool

## Overview

The **BMR Calculator** is a simple tool that allows users to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment. The calculator supports input of basic user data such as age, gender, weight, and height to compute their BMR using popular formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation.

### Features

- **Easy Input**: Users can input their gender, age, weight, and height to get accurate BMR calculations.
- **Accurate Calculation**: The tool uses reliable formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation to determine BMR.
- **JavaScript-Based**: Lightweight and fast, with all calculations performed on the client-side.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Formula Used

The BMR calculation is based on the **Harris-Benedict** equation, which varies based on gender:

### For Men:

\[
BMR=66.4730 + 13.7516 x weight in kg + 5.0033 x height in cm – 6.7550 x age in years
\]

### For Women:

\[
BMR=655.0955 + 9.5634 x weight in kg + 1.8496 x height in cm – 4.6756 x age in years
\]

## How to Use
